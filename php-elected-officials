Reflect on the reasons for differences in activities for the two elected officials.

Reflect on the reasons for differences in activities for the two elected officials.
What did the elected officials do differently during your selected week?
Both Mayors were extremely active on social media during my chosen week. Overall, both mayors had a fairly similar week in regards to accolades, speaking arrangements, and the number of press releases. The main noticeable difference during this week were the main initiatives going on at the time. Mayor Bowser’s main focus was on Violence and providing a safer city, where Mayor Pugh mainly focused on the Opioid Epidemic and the YouthWork program, designed to promote future healthy employment of the city’s youth.

Reflect on why such differences might have occurred and to what extent you think these differences are related to the health of the populations in their respective cities.
o These two cities are interesting as they are vastly differ in their constituent’s demographic profile. I believe the over health of their populations was the major difference in explaining why the initiatives between these two mayors are different. Obviously every city battles with violence, drug addiction, and unemployment, but one could see why these two cities would have different focal points based on their average income and educational levels of their population.

The activities of these 2 Mayors reflect the priorities their administrations have identified in their respective cities. In Baltimore City, crime, opioid addiction, unemployment and lack of good affordable housing options is a major concern, making it a top priority to be addressed by Mayor Pugh’s administration. The efforts to encourage keeping Baltimore clean highlight an initiative to show that some problems in the city can be solved with little resources, such as taking some time in the community to participate in a clean-up day. A difference between both mayors’ approach to protecting the environment, however, is prioritization of vehicle emission standards in DC compared to cleaning the city in Baltimore.

Like Baltimore, Washington DC faces sky-rocketing housing costs and the same lack of affordable housing options, and Mayor Bowser’s activity on this issue aims at encouraging developers to invest more in restoring and building family-size affordable housing units, to make DC a family-friendly city. The initiative to celebrate DC’s centenarians is also a focus on the investments announced last month as part of the “A Fair Shot FY2019 Proposed Budget and Financial Plan”, availing resources for a Safe at Home program, senior centers and a senior site focused on seniors’ comprehensive health and nutrition in Ward 8.
